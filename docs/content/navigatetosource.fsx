Navigate to Source
==============================

When the feature is enabled and users click Go to Definition (F12), Navigate to Source happens if:

 - current symbol originates from BCL libraries. The behaviour is to go to exact line in http://referencesource.microsoft.com/.
 - current symbol comes from an assembly with associated source-indexed pdb file. The behaviour is to go to the source code provider that hosts associated source code.

Here is a screencast of the feature in action:

I am a library author, what should I do to enable source indexing on my libraries?
-----------------------

You should run [SourceLink](http://ctaggart.github.io/SourceLink/) on pdb files and distribute these files with your NuGet packages. 
[ProjectScaffold](https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold) also includes a SourceLink target to make the process trivial to run.
Once the source-indexed pdb files are available, Navigate to Source should work as expected.

I am a normal user, what should I do to have Navigate to Source working?
-----------------------

Navigate to Source should work for any assembly if its source-indexed pdb file locates in the symbol cache directory.
You should enable source server support and set symbol cache directory -- see a simple guide at http://ctaggart.github.io/SourceLink/visualstudio.html. 
During the debugging process, pdb files will be downloaded and cached in this folder.
And the subsequent uses of these pdb files, Navigate to Source will pick them up.
